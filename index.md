As a Bachelor of Technology student in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Mahindra University, I am passionate about the intersection of robotics, AI, and sustainability. Always eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge, I am constantly exploring new areas of interest. My true passion lies in working with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop innovative solutions to complex problems. I am also deeply interested in the field of data science, which I believe has enormous potential to transform the way we approach decision-making and problem-solving. Above all, I am a dedicated team player who is always willing to help others and collaborate towards a common goal.
