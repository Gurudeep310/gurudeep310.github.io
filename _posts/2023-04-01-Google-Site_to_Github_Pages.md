Greetings!

I am excited to announce that I am making a shift from Google Sites to GitHub Pages for my website. This decision was driven by the numerous advantages that GitHub Pages offers, including greater control over website customization, the ability to collaborate with other developers, and access to a thriving community of contributors.
While this transition may seem daunting, I have been taking it step-by-step and learning from various YouTube tutorials. I am confident that with the help of the GitHub community and my growing skills, my website will be better than ever before
